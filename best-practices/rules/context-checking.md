# Context Checking Rules - CHECK BEFORE BUILDING

**Scope**: Universal - ALL projects
**Authority**: MANDATORY before any implementation
**Evidence**: 1+ hour saved per task by checking first

---

## Core Rule

**CRITICAL LESSON**: Before building ANYTHING, check if it already exists!

---

## Pre-Build Checklist (MANDATORY)

1. **Search context**: project documentation, learned patterns, existing code
2. **Search codebase**: grep for existing implementations, check src/ directories
3. **Use skills**: relevant project skills, existing skills directory
4. **Check system docs**: project's system documentation for existing APIs/endpoints
5. **Ask agents**: "Do we have infrastructure for X?" BEFORE building

---

## Enforcement

- VIOLATION: Building without checking context first
- CORRECT: Search -> Find existing -> Use it -> Adapt if needed
- GATE 1: "Does this already exist?" (MANDATORY before coding)

## ROI of Checking First

| Approach              | Time                    |
| --------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Checking first        | 5-10 minutes            |
| Building from scratch | 1-4 hours               |
| **SAVINGS**           | 50-240 minutes per task |
