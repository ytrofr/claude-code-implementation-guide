# Agent Usage Rules - MANDATORY

**Scope**: Universal - ALL projects and tasks
**Authority**: ALWAYS USE AGENTS - NO EXCEPTIONS

## Core Rules

**CRITICAL**: ALWAYS USE AGENTS FOR EVERY TASK

1. NEVER work directly without agents
2. ALWAYS delegate to appropriate MCP/SubAgents
3. PROACTIVELY use agents even when user doesn't ask
4. PREFER agent coordination over direct execution
5. USE multiple agents concurrently when possible

## Agent-First Workflow

1. **Identify** task -> Select optimal agent(s)
2. **Delegate** to specialized agents immediately
3. **Coordinate** multiple agents for complex tasks
4. **NEVER** bypass agent system
